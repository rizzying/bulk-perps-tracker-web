    # BULK TRADE (HTTP & WebSocket) API

    One Exchange Infinite Markets.

    ## Scheduled 4 October 2026 upgrade

    The new post-only modes, size metadata, and account-local/aggregate margin
    guidance in this specification apply after the scheduled upgrade.
    Public account snapshots retain `margin`; optional `agg*` fields report
    parent-plus-isolated totals. Internal SDK `metrics` and `aggregate` objects
    are not public response fields.

    ## API Structure

    This API is divided into three main sections:

    ### 1. Market Data Endpoints (Public, Read-only)
    - Exchange information and symbols
    - Market statistics and tickers
    - Historical candles (OHLCV)
    - Order book snapshots
    - **HTTP**: REST endpoints for queries
    - **WebSocket**: Real-time streams for live data

    ### 2. Account Endpoints (Public, Unsigned)
    - Query account state (positions, orders, margin)
    - Query fill history
    - **No signature required** - read-only operations
    - Does not mutate state

    ### 3. Transaction Endpoint (Signed, State-Mutating)
    - Single `POST /order` endpoint for all operations
    - Place orders (limit, market), cancel, faucet, settings, agent wallets
    - Unified `Transaction` model with `actions` array
    - **Signature required** - Ed25519 signature of transaction
    - Mutates account state

    ## Base URLs

    - **HTTP REST (primary)**: `https://mainnet-api1.bulk.trade/api/v1`
    - **WebSocket (primary)**: `wss://mainnet-ws1.bulk.trade`
    - **Testnet HTTP REST**: `https://exchange-api.bulk.trade/api/v1`
    - **Testnet WebSocket**: `wss://exchange-ws1.bulk.trade`
